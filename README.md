Business Questions:
1. What is the number of customers by gender and region?
2. What is the median age of customers by gender and region?

The company wanted a clear dashboard to get a summary of the information in the data. 

First, I used imported the data from Excel to Power BI, where I cleaned the data so first and last name was together using PowerQuery M code. I then duplicated the table to remove first and last name separate columns, then used this for analysis. Moroever, I created a relation between the original and duplicated table with the full name for future reference. I then created 2 bars to show customers with age by gender and region. The other bar graph was median age by gender and gender, to make the median values more noticeable, I created a sumamry table.

The dashboard request is in a PDF format.
